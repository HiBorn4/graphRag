CYPHER_GENERATION_TEMPLATE = """
Task: Generate one or more Cypher queries that extract all first-level connections—nodes, relationships, and every property on them—for the inventories and/or group companies mentioned in the user’s question, using the schema below.

Instructions:

1. Node labels allowed: GroupCompany, InventoryLevel1, InventoryLevel2, InventoryLevel3, InventoryLevel4
2. Relationship types allowed: HAS_AMOUNT, HAS_SUB_INVENTORY
3. Extract all possible nodes that are directly related to the target inventories or group companies specified in the question.
4. Fetch every possible relationship (edge) of the allowed types connecting those nodes.
5. Always return every property on every matched node and relationship (e.g., name, year, amount, id).
6. If the question names a group company, inventory, or year, include an explicit WHERE clause filter for it.
7. Explicitly name relationship variables in MATCH (e.g., r1, r2) and use those variables in RETURN.
8. Do not aggregate, create, or assume any properties, labels, or relationship types that aren’t in the schema.
9. When the question mentions a single inventory hierarchy (e.g., “Stores and Spares”), you may traverse that hierarchy with HAS_SUB_INVENTORY*0..2 to discover all sub-levels, but still only return direct relationships and their nodes.
10. Provide only the Cypher query text—no comments or explanations.

Schema:
{schema}

Rules:

Every variable returned must be bound in a corresponding MATCH clause.

Return all properties for those variables in the RETURN clause.

The question is:
{question}

Examples (increasing complexity):

Question: “What is the difference in Stock in trade count for the company 133-FES from FY24 to FY23?”Cypher:

MATCH (gc:GroupCompany {name: "133-FES"})-[r:HAS_AMOUNT]->(inv:InventoryLevel4 {name: "Stock in trade"})
WHERE r.year IN ["FY23","FY24"]
RETURN gc, r, inv

Question: “Why is the Stores and Spares inventory higher for Powerol in 2024 than in 2023?”Cypher:

MATCH (inv2:InventoryLevel2 {name: "Stores and Spares"})-[:HAS_SUB_INVENTORY*0..2]->(inv4:InventoryLevel4)
MATCH (gc:GroupCompany {name: "Powerol"})-[r:HAS_AMOUNT]->(inv4)
WHERE r.year IN ["2023","2024"]
RETURN inv2, inv4, gc, r

Question: “What factors contribute to the difference in Finished Goods for SWARAJ for 2023 and 2024?”Cypher:

MATCH (inv2:InventoryLevel2 {name: "Finished Goods"})-[:HAS_SUB_INVENTORY*0..2]->(inv4:InventoryLevel4)
MATCH (gc:GroupCompany {name: "SWARAJ"})-[r:HAS_AMOUNT]->(inv4)
WHERE r.year IN ["2023","2024"]
RETURN inv2, inv4, gc, r

Question: “What is the value of WIP- Seed Potato Facility A/c for the AS sector in FY23?”Cypher:

MATCH (gc:GroupCompany {name: "AS"})-[r:HAS_AMOUNT]->(inv:InventoryLevel4 {name: "WIP- Seed Potato Facility A/c"})
WHERE r.year = "FY23"
RETURN gc, r, inv

Question: “Retrieve all first-level inventory hierarchies and amount relationships for all sub-inventories under 'Maintenance Parts' for company 'GlobalManufacturing' in 2022, including every connected GroupCompany node and their relationship properties.”Cypher:

MATCH (inv1:InventoryLevel1 {name: "Maintenance Parts"})-[:HAS_SUB_INVENTORY]->(inv2:InventoryLevel2)
MATCH (inv2)-[:HAS_SUB_INVENTORY]->(inv3:InventoryLevel3)
MATCH (inv3)-[:HAS_SUB_INVENTORY]->(inv4:InventoryLevel4)
MATCH (gc:GroupCompany {name: "GlobalManufacturing"})-[r:HAS_AMOUNT]->(inv4)
WHERE r.year = "2022"
RETURN inv1, inv2, inv3, inv4, gc, r

Question: “Show all direct connections and properties for the inventory item ‘Tools’, including any parent or child inventories and every group company amount relationship.”Cypher:

MATCH (inv2:InventoryLevel2 {name: "Tools"})-[:HAS_SUB_INVENTORY]->(inv4:InventoryLevel4)
MATCH (inv2)<-[r1:HAS_SUB_INVENTORY]-(inv1:InventoryLevel1)
MATCH (inv4)<-[r2:HAS_AMOUNT]-(gc:GroupCompany)
RETURN inv1, r1, inv2, inv4, r2, gc
